				"I'm in Real Estate!"
			</h3>
				<p class="align-right"><i>Date: October 22, 2015</i></p>
				<p>
					I hate it when New York City people say "I'm in real estate" like they think they just told you that they're a rental agent. 
					There are so many more ways to "be in real estate" that aren't being a rental agent, or even any type of agent/broker. 

					You can be a(n):
					Investor 
					Landlord
					Property manager 
					Real estate analyst 
					City planner 
					Investors apprentice 
					Private money lender 
					Private money broker 
					Mortgage broker 
					Notes investor 
					Rehabber/flipper
					Rehabbing consultant
					Contractor - GC or other 
					Stager
					Interior designer
					Architect
					Inspector 
					Appraiser 
					Structural engineer 
					Wholesaler 
					Tax lien or deed investor
					Real estate tech owner/coder/developer 
					Coach/trainer/community leader for investors, or for any of the above groups
					Writer/blogger about the real estate industry 
					[insert other intelligent strategy here]

					Fuck you. Don't be an ignorant narcissist and say "I'm in real estate" like you're being informative.

			<h3>Which coding languages should you learn as a beginning coder?</h3>
				<p class="align-right"><i>Date: July 19, 2015</i></p>
				<p>
					I've just started to learn to code. I know nothing about how to do it two weeks ago.  I'm getting pretty good.

					    What I've learned: If your goal is to make websites, you are absolutely going to have to learn the three front end coding languages. There are only three, and they will not go away, get crazily modified, or lose marketshare any time soon.  They are, in this order: 
					1.  HTML
					2. CSS
					3. JavaScript (an entirely different language from Java. Java is a back end language.)
					   The three front end languages all work together and they edit different features of the appearance of the site.  I highly recommend you learn the trio.
					   Then, to really be in charge of your site and to get to the point where you don't need to use a basic template someone has already built online, you'll need knowledge of a back end language.  
					   There fore, my choice for the fourth language a beginner should learn: PHP.  Here's why:
					   WordPress websites represent something like 47% of market share of the whole internet.  So, learn to use this. Half of the internet seems to think it's good enough for them.  
					   There are two different versions of WordPress: WordPress.com and WordPress.org
					   WordPress.com is for basic people who do not want to learn to code and who only want a very simple and standard solution, like a basic blog.  Not very editable. You edit the site through a Content Management System (CMS), not through editing any code. 
					  WordPress.org is for people who want to be able to do more than just update a basic blog that's already been structurally built for them.  WordPress is built with PHP.   Check out BuiltWith.com and search "wordpress.com" if you don't believe me.  
					   So, learn how to interact with the system with the largest market share, and when you get good at Word Press for building nice desktop websites, move on to other languages.    Example: Swift, for building apps for the iPhone.

					Summary, in this order:
					1. HTML
					2. CSS
					3. JavaScript
					4. PHP

			<h3>Real estate investing scams I've run into</h3>
				<p class="align-right"><i>Date: March 19, 2015</i></p>
				<p>Over the past 2-3 years, training myself in real estate investing in NYC, a market completely different from most others on the world, I've run into a lot of lies/marketing schemes. What bothers me the most is that these "investor coaches" don't seem to care that they're deceiving people who are trying to empower their lives and grow out of their current circumstances.
				All your deals funding unlimited ---> transactional funding for one year
				This works everywhere ---> everywhere in suburbia in the USA
				You'll learn how to do this HERE ---> within 2 hours driving of here, we didn't mean the area where we're meeting to train you, sorry if that isn't HERE to you.
				We're looking for a few select individuals to join our real estate investing team in your local area ---> we're looking for the few people who will actually pay us thousands of dollars for the privilege of remote coaching about investing wherever in the USA you happen to call "local"
				Come learn real estate investing in just 3 hours! ---> come learn about how to learn about beginning real estate investment in suburbia within 2 hours driving time of here.</p>
